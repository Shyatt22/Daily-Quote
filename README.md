# Daily-Quote

This is a web app created using Python's Flask web framework for the backend along with HTML and CSS on the frontend. This app fetches data from an inspirational quote API (https://zenquotes.io/) to serve a daily inspirational quote. The daily quote is cached to allow for higher performance. This app has been deployed via Heroku and can be reached at https://dailydoseofinspiration.herokuapp.com/.
